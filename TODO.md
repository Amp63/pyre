# todo

## Refactoring
- Make `CodeBlock` better
  - Change `data` to `action`
  - Add a `type` attribute to make type access easy

## Other

- make item tags work with `Repeat: While` as well as `Select Object` blocks that contain conditional statements.
- add option to set string conversion
  - by default, python str converts to `text` but could be set to convert to `string`.
