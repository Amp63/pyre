## Other

- Make item tags work with `Repeat: While` as well as `Select Object` blocks that contain conditional statements.
  - I wrote this a while ago and I don't actually remember if I fixed this or not
- Add option to set string conversion
  - By default, python `str` converts to `Text` but could be set to convert to `String` instead.
